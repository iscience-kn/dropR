Title: Dropout Analysis by Condition
Description: Analysis and visualization of dropout between conditions in surveys and (online) experiments. Features include computation of dropout statistics, comparing dropout between conditions (e.g. Chi square), analyzing survival (e.g. Kaplan-Meier estimation), comparing conditions with the most different rates of dropout (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and visualizing the result of each in designated plotting functions.
