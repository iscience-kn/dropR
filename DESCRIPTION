Title: Dropout Analysis in R
Description: Analysis and visualization of dropout between conditions in surveys and (online) experiments. 
            Features include computation of dropout statistics, comparing dropout between conditions (e.g. Chi square), 
            analyzing survival (e.g. Kaplan-Meier estimation), comparing conditions with the most different rates of dropout 
            (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and visualizing the result of each in designated plotting functions.
