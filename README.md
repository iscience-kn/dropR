# dropR
drop out analysis with R and shiny

Finally I am fully rebuilding dropR. DropR is an interactive web based tool for dropout analysis combining the power of R
and user experience of shiny. dropR is based on the idea of Prof. Ulf-Dietrich Reips and myself. After an initial version was
released at the beginning of the previous year, I am incorporating user feedback and reviews to build a new shiny new version. 

Further information and a thorough description will be available here soon.
